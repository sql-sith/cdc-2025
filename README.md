## IT Club Cyber Defense, 2024-2025 season

This repository will hold meeting notes, source code, and anything else that seems valuable that seems like it fits better in here than in Zulip, or that we want to persist beyond Zulip's 10,000-post history.

## Resources

In addition to this GitHub site, we will be using a few other resources this year.

### Zulip

- [Zulip](https://cyberdefense.zulipchat.com) is a chat and collaboration platform. It's a lot like **Slack** (which we used last year).

  It is structured around "channels." When you post a message in a channel, you give it a topic, and people reply to that topic.

  The benefit of this is that instead of having an big list of messages in one "main thread," where most of the messages are not related to each other, each message is part of a named topic so you can distinguish unread messages easily and know which topics you want to stay caught up on. You will be sent an invitation to sign up for our **Zulip** server.

  Please install **Zulip** on your phone or laptop so that you will receive notifications whenever we post messages there. Make sure you pay special attention to the *announcements* and *meetings and homework* channels.

### ISERink

- [ISERink](https://iseage2.iseage.org) is a Virtual Machine platform (running VMWare VSphere) that Iowa State makes available for teams to use. It's basically the Internet in a bottle.

### Discord

- Iowa State runs a [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/843907386556416081/1136022052558614679) server where we can ask them questions. After you sign up on that server, you will be able to ask the **Innovate IT** staff and other students for help or talk to them for any other reason.

### Zoom

- [Zoom](https://zoom.us/download) will be used for video conferencing. This will allow us to share our screens with each other. The URL to join our Zoom meetings will be posted in the *resources/zoom url* topic in **Zulip**.

### YouTube

- [Our YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@cyberdefenseclub) will have videos of some of our meetings. I don't always have time to edit out dead air and mistakes, so I may post the videos in an "as-is" state. This is much better than me posting an edited version several weeks later, and it allows YouTube to create a transcript, which you can then search to jump to the part of the video you want.
