# Your Title Here, Having Something To Do With Scripting

### Iowa State Thing Next Week

Meet here sometime.

### My GoDaddy Security Hackathon Team Didn't Win Nuttin'

... but we had fun. Also, after being asked by our security org to drum up more interest, we as a team were able to see registered participants go from almost nobody to over 100 in about one week.

Another hackathon team found a vulnerability and informed me because I was part of an Active Directory group that owned the [Vulnerable Thing]. I made the decision to shut it down after a quick risk assessment, determining there would be no customer-facing or monetary risk. It felt good to make a decision and to know that it was OK for me to make the decision without asking others. My boss is always encouraging me to be more directive and less suggestive.

## Scripting with Bash is the Greatest Thing

### A sample script

For reference:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# exit if there's an error:
set -e 

# even if that error occurred in the middle of a pipeline:
set -o pipefail

# Define a function
square_number() {
    local number=$1
    local result=$((number * number))
    echo $result
    return 0
}

# Call the function and capture the returned value
number_to_square=5
squared_value=$(square_number $number_to_square)

# Use the returned value
echo "The square of $number_to_square is $squared_value."


```

### Variables in bash

#### Common types of variables

I will almost always use these terms interchangeably (sue me), but it's important to keep the difference in mind at all times.

**TL;DR**

**Shell variables** belong to the currently-executing shell only. Subshells (child processes) do not inherit these variables. You can think of them as temporary variables, or as variables with a local scope (local meaning the current shell).

```bash
# color=red
# echo $color
red
# start a subshell:
# bash
# echo $color
#
```

Note that in bash, you do not use $ when you reference a variable's value, but not when you reference its name.

**Environment variables** are a subset of shell variables that belong to the environment that spawns shells. This means that subshells *will* inherit these variables. To convert a shell variable to an environment variable, you **export** it.

```bash
# color=red
# echo $color
red
# start a subshell:
# bash
# echo $color
red
```

There are two common ways to undefine a variable. The first way is wrong:

```bash
# color=red
# echo $color
red
# red=
# # evidence that red is not an environment variable:
# env|grep red
# # however, it is a shell variable. people forget to look here:
# set|grep red
red=
```

The syntax `red=` does not undefine a variable. It redefines it as a environment variable (because it is not exported) that doesn't currently have a value.

This is the right way to undefine a variable:

```bash
# color=red
# export red
# # it's an shell variable:
# set|grep red
color=red
# # it's also an environment variable:
# env|grep red
color=red
# unset color
# # it's gone:
# set|grep red
# env|grep red
```
